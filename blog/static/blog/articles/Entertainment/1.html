Rahul Bose is back on the news but not because of his movies (was he ever in news because of his movies :p).
This time it is because he is #GoingBananas over the 2 bananas that he ordered while staying at JW Mariott
during his shoot in Chandigarh.
<br>
Rahul Bose was handed a bill of Rs. 442 with GST on an order of 2 bananas. The items on the bill were described
as "fruit platter".
